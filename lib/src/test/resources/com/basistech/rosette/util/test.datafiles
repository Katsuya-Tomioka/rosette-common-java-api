# This is a correctly formed configuration file for testing:

# This should create entries for the keys "eng", "spa" and "x_1":
*	*	src/test/resources/com/basistech/rosette/util/test_*.txt

# Override the existing "eng" key:
eng	*	rlpnc/no-such-directory/overridden_eng

# Add "x_2", "x_3" and "x_17":
x_2	*	rlpnc/no-such-directory/x_2
x_3	*	rlpnc/no-such-directory/x_3
x_17	*	rlpnc/no-such-directory/x_17

# This would match all the .datafiles in this directory, but since this
# isn't a VAX (!) it won't generate any keys:
*	VAX	src/test/resources/com/basistech/rosette/util/*.datafiles
